**Brain Tumor Classification**

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to classify brain tumors based on medical imaging data. The model uses a deep learning approach with the EfficientNet architecture for image classification tasks.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify brain tumor images into different categories (e.g., benign or malignant) using a dataset of brain MRI images. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, and the model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and EfficientNet for better performance.

Key Features
Image Classification: The model classifies brain tumor images into predefined categories.
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented before being fed into the model.
Model Architecture: Utilizes EfficientNetB0 as the base model with global average pooling, dropout layers, and a dense softmax output layer for classification.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report are generated to evaluate model performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains MRI images of brain tumors from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jaykumar1607/brain-tumor-mri-classification-tensorflow-cnn/input)

It is split into two main parts:

Training: Used to train the model.
Testing: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

Each subdirectory within "Training" and "Testing" contains images of specific categories of tumors (e.g., benign, malignant).

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:


Usage
Data Preprocessing: The images are first preprocessed (resized, normalized, etc.).
Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed images. You can adjust hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix. You can also visualize the results using training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
To run the Jupyter notebook and start the training process, execute the following:

jupyter notebook

Then, open the notebook brain_tumor_classification.ipynb and run the cells.

Model
The model uses EfficientNetB0 as the backbone for feature extraction and then adds a few additional layers to classify the images. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

Callbacks
The training process includes the following callbacks:

TensorBoard for real-time training visualization.
ModelCheckpoint to save the best model based on validation accuracy.
ReduceLROnPlateau to reduce the learning rate when the validation accuracy plateaus.
Results
Once the model has been trained, performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are displayed. The results show how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to medical image classification tasks. By leveraging EfficientNet and other advanced techniques, it is possible to achieve high classification accuracy for brain tumor detection in MRI images.
